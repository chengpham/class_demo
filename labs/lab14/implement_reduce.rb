# Implement a reduce method which takes an array, and initial value and a block as its arguments. Reduce is used to process lists (or arrays) of elements and return another value that is an aggregation of all the elements. You are not allowed to use Ruby's reduce or collect and you must use yield to execute the passed block.
# Here are some examples:

def reduce(arr,val)
    arr.each{|x| val = yield(val,x)}
    puts val
end


reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 0){|total, v| total + v } # => 21

reduce(["This", "is", "my", "sentence"], "") { |sentence, word| sentence + " " + word } # => "This is my sentence"

reduce([6, 5, 9, 2, 1, 10, 3], Float::INFINITY) do |min, v|
  if min > v
     v
  else
     min
  end
end
# => 1
